# Understanding JavaScript Destructuring Assignment (2025-03-23 09:13:55)

_**User**_

What does this mean. Why is the key name "data" but is later in the file accessed directly as variablke "users"?

In the line of code you provided:

```typescript
const { data: users = [], isLoading } = useUsers(true)
```

this is using **destructuring assignment** in JavaScript (and TypeScript). Here's a breakdown of what it means:

1. **`useUsers(true)`**: This is a function call that presumably returns an object. This object likely contains multiple properties, one of which is `data`.

2. **Destructuring**: The syntax `{ data: users = [], isLoading }` is destructuring the object returned by `useUsers(true)`. 
   - `data: users` means that the property `data` from the returned object is being assigned to a new variable called `users`.
   - `isLoading` is being assigned directly to a variable with the same name.

3. **Default Value**: The `= []` part means that if `data` is `undefined` (or not present), `users` will default to an empty array (`[]`). This is useful to avoid errors when trying to map over `users` later in the code.

So, in summary, the key name `data` is the original property name from the object returned by `useUsers`, but it is being renamed to `users` for easier access in the rest of the code. This allows you to refer to the list of users simply as `users` instead of `data`.
