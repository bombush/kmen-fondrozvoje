You said: "Since we're using React Query in a client component, we should use the useParams hook from next/navigation instead of accessing params directly:"

Why is thay so?

ðŸ¤–

In Next.js, when you're working with client components, the way you access route parameters can differ from server components. Hereâ€™s why you should use the `useParams` hook from `next/navigation` in client components:

1. **Client-Side Rendering**: Client components are rendered on the client side, meaning they can respond to user interactions and changes in state without needing a full page reload. The `useParams` hook is designed to work seamlessly in this environment, allowing you to access route parameters dynamically.

2. **React Query Integration**: When using React Query, you often want to fetch data based on route parameters. The `useParams` hook provides a straightforward way to access these parameters, ensuring that your data fetching logic can react to changes in the URL.

3. **Consistency**: Using `useParams` keeps your code consistent with the React hooks paradigm, making it easier to manage state and side effects in your components.

4. **Avoiding Direct Access**: Accessing parameters directly (e.g., through `props` or `context`) can lead to issues with reactivity and may not trigger re-renders when the URL changes. The `useParams` hook ensures that your component re-renders appropriately when the parameters change.

In summary, using `useParams` in client components aligns with the React paradigm, enhances reactivity, and simplifies data fetching with libraries like React Query.
