_**Assistant**_

ðŸ¤– To make the `SheetTitle` visible only for screen readers, you can use the `sr-only` class from TailwindCSS. This class hides the element visually but keeps it accessible for screen readers. Hereâ€™s how you can modify the `SheetTitle`:

```typescript:src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx
              <SheetTitle className="sr-only">Navigation</SheetTitle>
```

### Explanation of the Update:
- Added the `className="sr-only"` to the `SheetTitle` component to ensure it is only visible to screen readers.
