What is the maximum number of words I can use in a context for prompts

_**Assistant**_

ðŸ¤– The maximum context length varies depending on which model you're using. Here are the common limits for popular models:

1. GPT-4 Turbo: ~128,000 tokens (approximately 96,000 words)
2. GPT-4: ~32,000 tokens (approximately 24,000 words)
3. GPT-3.5 Turbo: ~16,000 tokens (approximately 12,000 words)
4. Claude 3 Opus: ~200,000 tokens (approximately 150,000 words)
5. Claude 3 Sonnet: ~100,000 tokens (approximately 75,000 words)
6. Claude 3 Haiku: ~32,000 tokens (approximately 24,000 words)

Keep in mind:
- 1 token â‰ˆ 0.75 words (rough approximation)
- Context includes both the prompt and the response
- Shorter contexts generally lead to more focused and relevant responses
- The actual usable context may be slightly less to leave room for the model's response

For your tech stack (NextJS, TypeScript, etc.), these limits are more than sufficient for most use cases like API documentation, code snippets, or technical specifications.
