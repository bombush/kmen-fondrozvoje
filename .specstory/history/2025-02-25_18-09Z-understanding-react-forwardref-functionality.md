ðŸ¤– 

`React.forwardRef` is a higher-order component in React that allows you to forward a ref through a component to one of its children. This is particularly useful when you want to allow parent components to directly interact with a child component's DOM node or instance.

### Key Points:
- **Ref Forwarding**: It enables the parent component to access the ref of a child component, which is not possible with regular functional components.
- **Use Case**: Commonly used in scenarios where you want to create a reusable component that needs to expose its underlying DOM node (like an input, button, etc.) to the parent.
- **Syntax**: You wrap your functional component with `React.forwardRef`, and the forwarded ref is passed as the second argument to the component.

### Example:
Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate:

```javascript
const MyInput = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
  <input ref={ref} {...props} />
));

// Usage
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const inputRef = React.useRef(null);

  const focusInput = () => {
    if (inputRef.current) {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <MyInput ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

In this example, `MyInput` is a functional component that forwards its ref to the underlying `<input>` element, allowing the parent component to call `focus()` on it.

what does React.useRef() do?

---

_**Assistant**_

ðŸ¤– 

`React.useRef()` is a hook in React that allows you to create a mutable object which holds a `.current` property. This object can be used to store a reference to a DOM element or to keep any mutable value that you want to persist across renders without causing a re-render when it changes.

### Key Points:
- **Mutable Reference**: The object returned by `useRef()` is mutable, meaning you can change its `.current` property without triggering a re-render of the component.
- **Accessing DOM Elements**: It is commonly used to directly access a DOM element, allowing you to perform actions like focusing an input, measuring dimensions, or integrating with third-party libraries that require direct DOM manipulation.
- **Persisting Values**: You can also use `useRef()` to store any value that you want to keep around without causing re-renders, such as timers or previous state values.

### Example:
Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate its usage:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const inputRef = React.useRef(null);

  const focusInput = () => {
    if (inputRef.current) {
      inputRef.current.focus(); // Focus the input element
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
      <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

In this example:
- `inputRef` is created using `React.useRef()`.
- The `ref` attribute of the `<input>` element is set to `inputRef`, allowing you to access the input element directly.
- When the button is clicked, the `focusInput` function is called, which uses `inputRef.current` to focus the input element. 

This demonstrates how `useRef()` can be used to interact with DOM elements directly.

# Fond rozvoje

## Overview
An app that allows users to create and fund projects in a manner similar to Kickstarter.
The app should be mobile-first and responsive.

## Design guidelines
- Support for dark mode including a toggle button

## Core functionalities
- User authentication (password+email and Google)
- Project management (create, edit, delete)
- Funding
- User management (create, edit, delete)
- Superuser functionality and permissions management

## Funding
### Currency
Currency used in the app is called CREDITS.
Users are awarded CREDITS based on a mechanism which will be described later.

### Project management and funding
- User can create a project and set funding goal (in CREDITS) and other parameters.
- User can fund a project.
- User can see all projects and choose to fund one.
- User can see all projects they have funded.
- User can see and manage all projects they have created.
